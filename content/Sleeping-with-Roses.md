You’ll love ‘Sleeping with Roses’ this summer! Tennessee native Kendra Copeland rinses the glass with one of her favorite ingredients, rose water, and a bit of Scrappy’s Cardamom bitters. She makes her rickey with Barr Hill by Caledonia Spirits Gin, Poli Miele Honey Grappa, Lime, her own Dried Rose Petal Syrup and Peychaud’s Bitters – then topped with both Club Soda and Tonic Water.
