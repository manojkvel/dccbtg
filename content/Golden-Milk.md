Golden Milk is a northern-Indian health beverage commonly made with turmeric, black pepper, honey and milk or coconut milk. Alison Hillard of Dram & Grain drew inspiration from Golden Milk to create the delicious Tumerickey â€“ a coconut-washed Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon, her own Turmeric & Black Peppercorn Soda, Neem Honey, Fresh Lime and Makrut Lime Leaf Tincture.
