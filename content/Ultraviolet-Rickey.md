Alexander Leidy infused a Meletti Anisette Secco with Blueberry & Lavender, enhancing the floral and citrus components of Green Hat Gin and composing a delightful ‘Ultraviolet Rickey’ with a bit of Lemon, Rosemary and Soda. Alexander is a founding member of a puppet theatre company in DC, as well as a Connecticut native *and* the creator of this lovely libation.
